# Project-Homepage
A homepage in the making just to showcase my most recent skills (mainly for HR personel).

Update: Had to delete the node modules folder and the .c9 folder in order to not to exceed 100 files. Now everything in the root folder is written by me.
Original project on cloud9 can be seen here:
https://ide.c9.io/nosterion/homepage


version 1.0: 
The plan is to make a homepage that features my photo gallery using node.js and express.
This version is very barebone, just to establish basic logic, routes and dependencies, etc.
I'm working mainly with ejs files, they are in the views folder. Beside that, I made the files in the root folder (JS and JSON files). The rest are just modules.
I'm making this on cloud9 (virtual workspace on cloud that lets me setup my own environment, for example node) and download the project when I make a new version and upload it here. Thats why there is a .c9 folder.
In next versions I plan to connect to databases (mongodb), handle the signup, login, etc. and do a comments section.
Everything is just to practise and show off some basic codewriting skills to HR, so content is subject to change.
